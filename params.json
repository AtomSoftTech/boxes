  "body": "What is this?\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis is a small python library for generating SVG drawings used for\r\ncutting out boxes or other structures using a laser cutter.\r\n\r\nIt also comes with a set of ready-to-use, fully parametrized generators:\r\n\r\n* Various simple boxes\r\n* Flex boxes with rounded corners and living hinges\r\n* Type trays with and without walls and floors\r\n* Book cover with flex spine\r\n* Magazine file\r\n\r\nAnd a few one trick ponies:\r\n\r\n* A drill stand\r\n* A castle tower\r\n* A housing for a special kind of lamp\r\n* A cutlery stand\r\n\r\nHave a look into the examples/ directory to see how the results look like.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n========\r\n\r\nOf course the library and the generators allow selecting the \"thickness\"\r\nof the material used and automatically adjusts lengths and width of\r\njoining fingers and other elements.\r\n\r\nThe \"burn\" parameter compensates for the material removed by the laser. This\r\nallows fine tuning the gaps between joins up to the point where plywood\r\ncan be press fitted even without any glue.\r\n\r\nFinger Joints are the work horse of the library. They allow 90Â° edges\r\nand T connections. Their size is scaled up with the material\r\n\"thickness\" to maintain the same appearance. The library also allows\r\nputting holes and slots for screws (bed bolts) into finger joints,\r\nalthough this is currently not supported for the finished generators.\r\n\r\nDovetail joints can be used to join pieces in the same plane.\r\n\r\nFlex allows bending and stretching the material in one direction. This\r\nis used for rounded edges and living hinges.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to use the available generators:\r\n\r\n* Execute the scripts/boxes tool and pass the name of the generator together with the measurements on the command line\r\n* Run scripts/boxesserver which provides an web interface on port 8000\r\n",
